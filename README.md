# Portfolio-Optimization

## Idea:
Find an optimum porfolio by using a numerical method to create porfolios invoking random weights and testing beta-return for each
combination of weights. Then selecting the weights that leads to the highest return-beta slope (optimum portfolio)

## Algorithmic approach:
1. Create a large set of porforlios having distinct weights
2. Obtain the volatility, expected return and beta for each portfolio
3. Return the porforlio with the higherst return-to-beta slope
